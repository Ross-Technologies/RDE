# RDE

The official Ross Desktop Environment. A lightweight desktop environment for Linux. The purpose of RDE is that it's compatible with every GNOME application and can work as well as GNOME but without any issues. This was designed because [SpaceboyRoss01](https://github.com/SpaceboyRoss01), the original designer, wanted a desktop environment that's simple, not hard to use, customizable, and uses little to no resources. The goal is to design most of the desktop environment in Node.JS and leave OpenBox in C. As of right now, the desktop environment is more of a bundle of settings.
