# RDE

The official Ross Desktop Environment. A lightweight desktop environment for Linux. The purpose of RDE is that it's compatible with every GNOME application and can work as well as GNOME but without any issues. This was designed because [SpaceboyRoss01](https://github.com/SpaceboyRoss01), the original designer wanted a desktop environment that's simple, not hard to use, customizable, and uses little to no resources.
